# Antlr4ForNetBeans
Antlr4 Editor Module for NetBeans

This project is in very early stage. It may damage Your computer or do any other weird things, so check before using any part of it and USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Besides this, this project tries to provide an editor for Antlr4 syntax, integrated into NetBeans.

For the sake of usability, it includes antlr jar files, which may be outdated.
